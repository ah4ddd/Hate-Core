# Hate-Core

---

**Hate-Core** is my first serious Python game, inspired by Dark Souls. You control a lone knight in a 2D world, fighting dragons, surviving as long as possible, and trying to beat your high score. I built this as a learning project with **Pygame**, experimenting with sprites, music, and simple game mechanics. Still a beginner, so there’s a lot to improve!

---

## Features

* 2D hack-and-slash combat
* Sprites and animations for characters and dragon
* Background music and sound effects
* Keyboard and touch controls
* High-score system

## Notes

* This is a Phase 1 project, so mechanics are simple.

## Future Improvements
